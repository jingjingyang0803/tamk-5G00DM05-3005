# Instructions for Running SQL Files

To create and manage the SQLite database, follow the instructions below:

1. `sqlite3 database.db < sql/create.sql` - to create the Clothes table.
2. `sqlite3 database.db < sql/insert.sql` - to insert data into the Clothes table.
3. `sqlite3 database.db < sql/delete.sql` - only use this if you want to delete all data from the Clothes table.

Please note that to run these scripts, you should have SQLite installed on your system and use the SQLite command-line utility.
